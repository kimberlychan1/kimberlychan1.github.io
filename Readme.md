# Kimberly Chan about-me site
## Content
### **Main**
>* Keep things simple with fixed header and a collapsible menu by Bootstrap
>* Scroll down button to go to  with the about section
>* Typewriter effect by TypeIt (CDN) to simply introduce myself 
>* Used media queries to adjust the big-font-size to make the font size responsive as well

### **About**
>* This section is about what I do before the bootcamp, reasons of joining and my expectation
>* In order to align the content nicely, grid seems a better choice than inline-block

### **Skills**
>* Used [span] to make the bars
>* To make the colour bar moves, I used ScrollReveal. So it would move when the user scrolls to this part

### **Portfolio** 
>* To display my future project
>* Hover over the images to show project name and button
>* After clicking the button, would direct to another page to display how the project look like in
phone with video and pictures to show how it looks like on computer
>* Go back button direct back to the portfolio part of the front page

### **Contact**
>* Used a comment form and a chat box
>* Chat box: showing more by clicking the buttons(JS onclick function)<br>
//Want to make it like chatbot but probably in the future after I develop the needed skills//
>* The comment form details would be sent to my email(formspree)
>* With a gif background, look a bit more fancy(I think:))


### **Others**
>* **Responsive webpage** : I used media queries for the font and bootstrap for the display 
>* **Scroll to top button** : By javascript. I learnt this from W3Schools. It's a really helpful website. Instead of just showing the code, it also told me what the code is trying to do
>* **Consistent color and font size** : I found it's a bit troublesome to look for the font-size/colour that I've used and found that :root{} could make everything more convenient
>* **My best friends in making this webpage: Google and Youtube**
